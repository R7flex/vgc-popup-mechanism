When VGC starts with VALORANT. Vgc creating popup thread but thread entry pointing RWX allocation in VGC.
I dumped that allocation and analyzed.
This is the thread:
15396      |      0xFFFFCE0928CAB080      |      0x000000E4502CF000      |      8      |      0x000001E792253CE0      |            |      9      |      Waiting

LOL
